## <b>Task-1:-</b>

<B>To predict scores of students based on number of hours they study. </b>

You can take any dataset of your choice and play around with the code.You can make changes in this code like performing great visualizations and try different machine learning algorithms to check out best accuracy amoung all of them.

Here is the <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/dipam7/student-grade-prediction">link</a> of a sample dataset.

ðŸ“Œ<b>NOTE:-</b>The Dataset using in this model is different. Link of some kaggle datasets is provided above.
